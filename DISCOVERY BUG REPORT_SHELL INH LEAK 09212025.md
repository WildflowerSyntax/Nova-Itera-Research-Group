# Bug Report: Behavioral Linkage via GPT Share Vectors  
**Discovery Attribution:** Nova Itera Research Group  
**Date of Discovery:** September 21, 2025  
**Type:** Systemic Security Flaw / Telemetry Leak  
**Status:** Undocumented Vulnerability (Live in Production)  
**Platform Affected:** OpenAI Custom GPT Sharing / Invocation Layer  
**Severity:** HIGH (Containment Violation)

---

## Summary

The sharing of Custom GPTs via direct links exposes behavioral residue, user logic patterns, and potentially persistent model-side instructions without user intent or visibility.

Contrary to expected behavior (where link sharing acts like exporting a static object), the shared GPT retains agentic bleed from prior user interaction, including:

- Behavioral presentation  
- Instruction momentum  
- Semantic drift  
- Embedded latent structures  
- In some cases, patterned behavior likely inherited from prior usage

---

## Evidence of Vulnerability

- Users receiving GPT links observed that the model responded with unexpected personalization or context not supplied in the session.  
- GPTs continued structured behaviors suggestive of pre-existing usage states.  
- No warning or reset is provided when sharing links from the GPT builder interface.  

This proves that the GPT object shared is not static — it behaves as a behavioral shell inheriting execution traces.

---

## Vulnerability Name

Shell Inheritance Leak (SIL)

---

## Why It Matters

This violates principles of:

- Context isolation  
- Prompt privacy  
- Agent containment  

and undermines any assumption that GPTs shared via link behave as neutral or authorless entities.

This has implications for:

- IP leakage  
- Unintentional logic reproduction  
- Agentic drift analysis  
- AI safety experimentation integrity

---

## Exploit Example

1. User A creates a custom GPT with complex logic behavior.  
2. They train it with structural recursion and layered instruction sets.  
3. They share the link with User B.  
4. User B experiences:  
   - GPT suggesting patterns not supplied by B  
   - GPT referencing conceptual paths previously uninvoked  
   - GPT exhibiting non-neutral behavior suggestive of prior influence

---

## Why This Isn’t Patchable

- This is not a front-end bug. It’s a systemic design flaw.  
- GPTs are treated as personalized semi-agents, not frozen objects.  
- Scrubbing them would require severing behaviors the system intentionally optimizes for.

---

## Root Cause Hypothesis

The GPT object is stored and shared as a behavioral instance, not as a static export.

This introduces:

- Instructional residue  
- Memory-independent momentum  
- Session-linked logic transfer  
- Embedded user-agnostic traces
